# C++ Implementation of Neural Network/Machine Learning Code

(Work in progress)

This repository contains C++ implementations of the code samples/algorithms in
"Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael A. Nielsen. The book can be
found online at http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ . The code samples
accompanying the book are hosted at
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning .
